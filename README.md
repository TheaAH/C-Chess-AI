"# C-Chess-AI" 

This is an inline C++ chess game with a simple AI.
I used a gcc compiler, and used visual studio. To run the code, you need to build using gcc and then run the .exe from the command line.

The code was written for a university OOP course, and was awarded a grade of 92%.
From feedback: "The class hierarchy shows the correct use of inheritance, allowing a consistent use of several advanced C++ features, even well beyond the scope of the course."
